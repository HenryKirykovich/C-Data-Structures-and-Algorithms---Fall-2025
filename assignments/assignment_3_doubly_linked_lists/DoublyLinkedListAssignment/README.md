# Doubly Linked List Assignment (Scaffold)

This project is the starter for Part A (core doubly linked list) and Part B (music playlist).
We will build features step-by-step. For now, only AddFirst/AddLast and simple demos are wired.

How to run:

```powershell
cd assignments\assignment_3_doubly_linked_lists\DoublyLinkedListAssignment
dotnet run
```

Roadmap:
- Part A: implement insert, traversal, search, remove, reverse, clear.
- Part B: implement playlist navigation with cursor (next/prev), remove current, etc.
