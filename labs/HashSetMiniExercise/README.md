HashSet Mini Exercise

Overview

This is a small demo project that implements the "Mini Group Exercise: Thinking in HashSet<T>" as a runnable console program. It sketches three scenarios (A/B/C), explains the HashSet type used, key policy and core operations, and provides a tiny runtime demo for each scenario.

How to run

Build:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\info\Desktop\C-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms---Fall-2025\labs\HashSetMiniExercise"

# build
dotnet build
```

Run all demos:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\HashSetMiniExercise.csproj
```

Run a specific scenario (A/B/C):

```powershell
# scenario A
dotnet run --project .\HashSetMiniExercise.csproj -- A
```

Notes

- The project is intentionally small and focused on design reasoning + a minimal demo.
- If you want, I can expand this with unit tests, more normalization, or a short worksheet version for student groups.
